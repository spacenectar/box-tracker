# ADR 003: Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript

- **Date created**: 04/02/2025
- **Driver**: Alex Foxleigh (Foxy)

## Status

![accepted]

## Context

Decide to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript for the frontend.

## Advice

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) offers a lot of benefits over
JavaScript. It is a superset of JavaScript and is a very popular language,
so we should not struggle to find developers who can use it.

It adds the ability to write code in a strongly typed language, which means that
we can use type-safe code and avoid bugs. Strongly typed code is easier to understand
and maintain, and it is easier to test.

## Discussions

- Alex Foxleigh - This is the place to discuss the ADR. Please keep the discussion
  on topic and try to avoid repeating the same points. Please put your name next to
  any points you make.

## Decision

Implement TypeScript over JavaScript.

## Consequences

- Maintenance of the codebase will be easier
- TypeScript has a larger learning curve than JavaScript but once this curve has
  been overcome, developers usually find TypeScript easier to understand and maintain.
  As our current projects already use TypeScript, this should not be a problem.
- TypeScript improves code quality and catches errors before they happen.
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, so it is still possible to write JavaScript
  code in TypeScript.
- TypeScript is a very popular language, so we should not struggle to find developers
  who can use it.
- There is a large community of developers who are willing to help with any issues
  we may have.
