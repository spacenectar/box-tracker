{/* <Tip type="note">
  It is recommended that you use the [TableFactory](/?path=/docs/components-factories-table-factory--docs) component instead of the 'Table' component as this will generate a table for you based on the data you provide as well as providing additional functionality such as sorting, filtering and pagination.

You can also make the table rows striped by adding the `striped` prop.
