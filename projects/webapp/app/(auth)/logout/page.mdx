# Logout page

This page uses Clerk's third-party authentication components and does not have a dedicated Storybook story.

## Implementation Details

The logout page leverages Clerk's `SignOut` component, which provides a complete authentication flow including:

- Social login options
- Password reset functionality
- Account verification

## Why No Story?

The `SignOutButton` component from Clerk requires specific context providers and router functionality that are challenging to mock in a Storybook environment. Additionally, the component makes API calls to Clerk's authentication services during rendering, which would not work properly in isolation.

For testing and development of this page, please use the actual application environment where all required contexts and services are properly configured.

## Component Source

The logout page is implemented in `projects/webapp/app/logout/page.tsx` and uses the following key components:

```tsx
import { SignOutButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";
```

For more information on Clerk's authentication components, please refer to [Clerk's documentation](https://clerk.com/docs).
