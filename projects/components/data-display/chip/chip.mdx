## Basic Chip
By default, a chip only requires the 'text' prop to be passed in. If no other props
are provided then the chip will be rendered with the default styling and no delete icon.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.Default} />

## Deletable Chip

A Chip can be made deletable by passing in the 'onDelete' prop. This will display
a delete icon on the right side of the chip and will call any function passed to
the 'onDelete' prop when the icon is clicked.

## Chip with status colours

A Chip can be given a status colour by passing in the 'status' prop. This will
display the chip with the appropriate colour. The status prop can be one of the
following: 'success', 'warning', 'error', 'info'. You can also pass 'default' as
a a status prop but this is the equivalent of not passing a status prop at all.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.SuccessStatus} />
<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.WarningStatus} />
<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.DangerStatus} />
<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.InfoStatus} />
