# THIS FOLDER IS AUTO-GENERATED

## DO NOT EDIT/DELETE OR ADD ANY FILES IN THIS FOLDER

All files in this folder are automatically generated by the
'scripts/icons.mjs' script.

If you want to add a new icon, add an SVG file with the icon name (in kebab-case)
to the 'projects/assets/icons' folder and run 'nx run scripts:generate-icons' to generate the new
icon component.

If you want to delete an icon, delete the SVG file from the 'projects/assets/icons' folder
and run 'nx run scripts:generate-icons' to delete the icon component.

If you want to edit an icon, edit the SVG file in the 'projects/assets/icons' folder and
run 'nx run scripts:generate-icons' to regenerate the icon component.
