<Description  />

Please view the [Table](?path=/docs/components-data-display-table--docs) component to see the component in an actual `Table` component.

{/* <WorksWith /> */}

<Primary />

<Controls />

By default the TableCell component will render a `<td>` element, but you can also use it as a `<th>` element by setting the `th` prop to `true` e.g. `<TableCell th>`.

<Canvas withToolbar sourceState="shown" of={Stories.RenderTh} />

## Responsive Tables

In order to render a table responsively, you must add a contextHeader prop to the TableCell component.

This will tell the table which table header the cell belongs to. This prop is only optional under the following conditions:

- The TableCell has the `th` prop set to `true`
- The TableCell is part of a table with no headers

Failure to provide a contextHeader prop will result in the table failing to render correctly on smaller screens.
