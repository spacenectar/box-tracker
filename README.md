# Box Tracker ðŸ“¦

Welcome to Box Tracker, the ultimate solution for organizing and tracking all your stuff in boxes, across multiple locations, and even with multiple users! This repo is structured as a monorepo managed by `Nx`, with separate folders for the backend (`FastAPI`) and the frontend (`Next.js`).

Disclaimer: These docs are a work in progress and will evolve as the project develops. They are mostly just here for my reference at the moment.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: `Next.js` (React)
- Backend: `FastAPI` (Python) with `PostgreSQL`
- Monorepo Management: `Nx`
- Infrastructure:
  - `Docker` for containerization
  - `Docker Compose` for service orchestration
- Documentation: Markdown files in `/docs`

### /docs

All the project documentation, including architectural diagrams, technical decisions, and implementation notes.

### /projects/webapp

The `Next.js` front-end. You can install dependencies with `yarn install` and start the development server using `nx run webapp:serve`.

### /projects/backend

The `FastAPI` backend that handles authentication, API endpoints, and database interactions.

**Note:** The backend is designed to run inside Docker, and you should not run it manually outside of the containerized environment.

---

## Getting Started

### Before you begin

1. Clone the Repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spacenectar/box-tracker.git
   cd box-tracker
   ```

2. Ensure you have Docker installed and running.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the values as needed.

---

### Running the Project

#### Backend (Runs in Docker)

To start the backend (including `PostgreSQL`):

```bash
docker-compose up backend
```

This will:

- Start the `FastAPI` backend inside a container.
- Connect it to a `PostgreSQL` database inside Docker.

#### Frontend

To start the `Next.js` frontend:

```bash
nx run webapp:serve
```

This will start the development server, and the app should be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Running Everything

You can start both the frontend and backend in one step:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Using Nx Commands

This project is managed using `Nx`, which allows for efficient task execution.
Here are some useful commands:

### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### Run the backend inside Docker

```bash
docker-compose up backend
```

### Run the frontend

```bash
nx run webapp:serve
```

### Run database migrations

```bash
nx run backend:migrate
```

### Seed the database

```bash
nx run backend:seed
```

### Lint the code

```bash
nx format
```

- `projects/webapp/`: Frontend (`Next.js`).
- `projects/backend/`: Backend (`FastAPI`).
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines how services (backend, database) are containerized.
