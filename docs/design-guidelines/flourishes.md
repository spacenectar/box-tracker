# Design flourishes

Design flourishes are things which add a little bit of flair to the design. They
can be things like:

- Borders
- Round corners
- Shadows

etc...

## Borders

Border width is `1px` and is solid, the colour is the value of the `$col-border`
variable.

## Border radius

The default border radius value is defined in the `$border-radius` variable.

## Shadows

The shadow is generated with the `generate-box-shadow()` utility.
The style for that shadow is defined there.
